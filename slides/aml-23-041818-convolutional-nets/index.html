There are two interfaces to keras, sequential and the
functional, but we’ll only discuss sequential.
Sequential is for feed-forward neural networks where
one layer follows the other. You specify the layers as
a list, similar to a sklearn pipeline.
Dense layers are just matrix multiplications. Here we
have a neural net with 32 hidden units for the mnist
dataset with 10 outputs. The hidden layer nonlinearity
is relu, the output if softmax for multi-class
classification.
You can also instantiate an empty sequential model
and then add steps to it.
For the first layer we need to specify the input shape
so the model knows the sizes of all the matrices. The
following layers can infer the sizes from the previous
layers.

Useful for grid-search.
You need to define a callable that returns a compiled
model.
You can search parameters that in Keras would be
passed to “fit” like the number of epochs.

???
Training longer overfits more and more units overfit
more, but both also lead to better results.
We should probably train much longer actually.
Setting the number of epochs via cross-validation is a
bit silly since it means starting from scratch again
each time. Using early stopping would be better.

# Drop-out Regularization

- Randomly set activations to zero.

.center[
![:scale 55%](images/dropout_reg.png)
]

- https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf

- Rate often as high as .5, i.e. 50% of units set to zero!

- Predictions: use all weights, down-weight by rate

???
Drop out is a very successful regularization technique
developed in 2014. It is an extreme case of adding
noise to the input, a previously established method to
avoid overfitting.
Instead of adding noise, we actually set given inputs to
0. And not only on the input layer, also the
intermediate layer.
For each sample, and each iteration we pick different
nodes. Randomization avoids overfitting to particular
examples.
---

#Ensemble Interpretation

- Every possible configuration represents different
network.

- With p=.5 we jointly learn `$\binom{n}{n/2}$` networks

- Networks share weights

- For last layer dropout: prediction is approximate
geometric mean of predictions of sub-networks.

#Definition of Convolution


`$$ (f*g)[n] = \sum\limits_{m=-\infty}^\infty f[m]g[n-m] $$`

`$$ = \sum\limits_{m=-\infty}^\infty f[n-m]g[m] $$`

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/convolution.png)
]

???
The definition is symmetric in f, but usually one is the
input signal, say f, and g is a fixed “filter” that is
applied to it.
You can imagine the convolution as g sliding over f.
If the support of g is smaller than the support of f (it’s
a shorter non-zero sequence) then you can think of it
as each entry in f * g depending on all entries of g
multiplied with a local window in f.
Not that the output is shorter than the input by half the
size of g. this is called a valid convolution.
We could also extend f with zeros, and get a result that
is larger than f by half the size of g, that’s called a
full convolution. We can also just pad a little bit and
get something that is of the same size as f.
Also not that the filter g is flipped as it’s indexed with
-m

???
Here is the architecture of an early convolutional net
form 1998. The basic architecture in current
networks is still the same.
You can multiple layers of convolutions and resampling
operations. You start convolving the image, which
extracts local features. Each convolutions creates
new “feature maps” that serve as input to later
convolutions.
To allow more global operations, after the convolutions
the image resolution is changed. Back then it was
subsampling, today it is max-pooling.
So you end up with more and more feature maps with
lower and lower resolution.
At the end, you have some fully connected layers to do
the classificattion.

Here are two more recent architectures, AlexNet from
2012 and VGG net from 2015.
These nets are typically very deep, but often have very
small convolutions. In VGG there are 3x3
convolutions and even 1x1 convolutions which serve
to summarize multiple feature maps into one.
There is often multiple convolutions without pooling in
between but pooling is definitely essential.

# the data, shuffled and split between train and test sets
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()


X_train_images = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
X_test_images = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
input_shape = (img_rows, img_cols, 1)

y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)
```
]


???
For convolutional nets the data is n_samples, width,
height, channels.
MNIST has one channel because it’s grayscale. Often
you have RGB channels or possibly Lab.
The position of the channels is configurable, using the
“channels_first” and “channels_last” options – but
you shouldn’t have to worry about that.

cnn.add(Flatten())
cnn.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))

???
For convolutional nets we need 3 new layer types:
Conv2d for 2d convolutions, MaxPooling2d for max
pooling and Flatten go reshape the input for a dense
layer.
There are many other options but these are the most
commonly used ones.

#Batch Normalization

.center[

- https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167

???
Another relatively recent advance in neural networks is
batch normalization. The idea is that neural networks
learn best when the input is zero mean and unit
variance. We can scale the data to get that.
But each layer inside a neural network is itself a neural
network with inputs given by the previous layer. And
that output might have much larger or smaller scale
(depending on the activation function).
Batch normalization re-normalizes the activations for a
layer for each batch during training (as the
distribution over activation changes). The avoids
saturation when using saturating functions.
To keep the expressive power of the model, additional
scale and shift parameters are learned that are
applied after the per-batch normalization.

#Using pre trained  networks

.center[

???
Often we have a small but specific image dataset for a
particular application. Training a neural net is not
feasible unless we have tens of thousands or
hundreds of thousands of images.
However, if we have a convolutional neural net that
was already trained on a large dataset that is similar
enough, we can hope that the features it learned are
also helpful for our task.
The easiest way to adapt a trained network to a new
task is to just apply it to our dataset and take the
activations of the second to last or last layer.
If the original task was rich enough – say 10000
different classes as in imagenet – these layers
contain a lot of information about the image.
We can then use these activations as features for
another classifier like a linear model or smaller dense
neural network.

The main point is that we don’t need to retrain all the
weights in the network. You can think of it as
retraining only the last layer – the classification layer
– of the network, while holding all the convolutional
filters fixed. If they learned generic patterns like
edges and patterns, these will still be useful for your
task.
You can download pre-trained neural networks for
many architectures online.
Using a pre-trained network is sometimes also known
as transfer learning.
This potentially doesn’t work with images from a very
different domain, like medical images.

#Finetuning

- Start with pre-trained net

- Back-propagate error through all layers

- “tune” filters to new data.

A more complicated variant of this is to load a network
trained on some other dataset, and replace the last
layer with your classification task.
Instead of training only the last layer, we can also keep
training all the previous layers, backpropagating the
gradient through the network and adjusting the
previously learned filters for our task.
You can think of this as warm-starting a neural network
from one that was trained on another dataset.
If you do that, we often want to train the last layer a
little bit before we backpropagate through the
network. Otherwise the random initialization of the
last layer might destroy the filters that we used for
initialization.

#Adverserial Samples

- Intriguing properties of neural networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199
???
Since convolutional neural nets are so good at image
recognition, some people think they are pretty
infallible. But they are not. There is this interesting
paper about intriguing properties of neural networks,
that introduces adverserial samples.
Adverserial samples are samples that were created by
an adversary or attacker to fool your model. Here,
they changed images to be classified as Ostrich by
AlexNet trained on imagenet.
The picture on the left is change just slightly, and went
from correctly classified to classified as Ostrich.
This technique uses gradient descent on the input and
requires access to all the weights in the network to
create the samples.
Given how high-dimensional the input space is, this is
not very surprising from a mathematical perspective,
but it might be somewhat unexpected.
